# Clinical Login Troubleshooting Guide

## Issue Fixed
The clinical login system was failing due to incorrect API request handling in the frontend authentication service.

## Root Cause
The error "'/api/auth/login' is not a valid HTTP method" was caused by the authentication service not properly handling the login request.

## Resolution Applied
1. **Fixed Authentication Service**: Updated the login method in `client/src/lib/auth.ts` with proper error handling
2. **Added Debug Logging**: Console logs to track authentication flow
3. **Verified Backend**: Confirmed API endpoint works correctly via curl test

## Valid Clinical User Accounts

The following accounts are available for clinical staff login:

### Administrator
- **Username**: `admin`
- **Password**: `admin123`
- **Role**: Admin
- **Access**: Full system access, user management, cohort management

### Clinician
- **Username**: `dr.smith`
- **Password**: `password123`
- **Role**: Clinician
- **Access**: Patient data, assessments, clinical dashboard

### Researcher
- **Username**: `researcher1`
- **Password**: `research123`
- **Role**: Researcher
- **Access**: Research data, analytics, longitudinal studies

## Login Flow
1. Navigate to `/clinical/login`
2. Enter username and password
3. System validates credentials against `clinical_users` table
4. On success, receives auth token and user data
5. Redirects to clinical dashboard with proper authorization

## API Endpoint Verification
Backend authentication confirmed working:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username":"dr.smith","password":"password123"}'
```

Response:
```json
{
  "token": "2",
  "user": {
    "id": 2,
    "username": "dr.smith",
    "email": "smith@clinic.com",
    "firstName": "John",
    "lastName": "Smith",
    "role": "clinician"
  }
}
```
