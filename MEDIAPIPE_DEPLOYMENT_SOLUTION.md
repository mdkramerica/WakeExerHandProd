# MediaPipe Production Deployment Solution

## Problem
MediaPipe fails in deployed environments with "constructor not found" errors, even when direct imports appear successful.

## Working Solution
Use CDN-first loading strategy with enhanced fallback handling:

### Key Implementation Points:

1. **CDN-First Loading**: Load MediaPipe from jsdelivr CDN before attempting direct imports
   ```javascript
   script.src = 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@mediapipe/hands@0.4.1675469240/hands.js';
   ```

2. **Timing Checks**: Wait for MediaPipe to be available on window object with polling
   ```javascript
   let attempts = 0;
   while (attempts < 20 && !(window as any).Hands) {
     await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 100));
     attempts++;
   }
   ```

3. **Fallback Strategy**: 
   - First: CDN loading with window.Hands
   - Second: Direct import as fallback
   - Third: Camera-only mode if both fail

4. **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation to camera-only mode prevents app crashes

## Critical Success Factors:
- CDN loading MUST come before direct import attempts
- Proper timing delays for script initialization
- Cross-origin anonymous loading for CDN scripts
- Polling mechanism to wait for MediaPipe availability
