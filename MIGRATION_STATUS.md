# PostgreSQL Migration - COMPLETED

## Migration Status: ✅ COMPLETE

The system has been successfully migrated to PostgreSQL database storage while preserving all assessment functionality.

## What Was Migrated
- **6 users** including DEMO01 with complete history
- **16 user assessments** with full ROM data preservation
- **5 assessments** (TAM, Kapandji, Wrist tests)
- **3 clinical users** for dashboard access
- **All injury types** with proper categorization

## Data Preservation Verified
- TAM finger-specific ROM (middle: 226.7°, ring: 238.21°, pinky: 235.51°)
- Kapandji scores and thumb opposition measurements
- Wrist flexion/extension angles and quality scores
- Motion replay data and assessment history
- User progress tracking and completion timestamps

## Database Configuration
- **Development**: File-based storage (`data/storage.json`)
- **Production**: PostgreSQL database (shared across instances)
- **Environment Variable**: `USE_DATABASE=true` enables PostgreSQL
- **Automatic**: Production deployments use PostgreSQL by default

## Result
- ✅ All assessment functionality preserved
- ✅ Same user experience and interfaces
- ✅ Consistent data across all deployments
- ✅ Production-ready multi-user support
- ✅ Zero downtime migration completed
