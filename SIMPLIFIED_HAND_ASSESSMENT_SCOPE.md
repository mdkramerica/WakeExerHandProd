#### C. Wrist Flexion/Extension
- **Purpose**: Wrist mobility measurement
- **Duration**: 15 seconds
- **Instructions**: Flex and extend wrist through full range
- **Output**: Maximum flexion and extension angles

#### D. Wrist Radial/Ulnar Deviation
- **Purpose**: Side-to-side wrist movement
- **Duration**: 15 seconds
- **Instructions**: Move wrist left and right
- **Output**: Deviation angles in both directions

#### E. DASH Survey
- **Purpose**: Functional disability questionnaire
- **Duration**: 5-10 minutes
- **Format**: 30 standardized questions
- **Output**: Disability score (0-100)

### 4. Motion Tracking Integration
- MediaPipe Holistic for real-time hand tracking
- Quality validation and error detection
- Motion data recording and replay
- Confidence scoring for assessment reliability

### 5. Admin Dashboard
