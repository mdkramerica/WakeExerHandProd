# Visibility-Based Temporal Validation Enhancement

## Overview
Enhanced the temporal validation system to distinguish between tracking errors and legitimate high ROM values based on finger visibility assessment.

## Problem Statement
The initial temporal validation system was rejecting all sudden ROM changes, including legitimate high ROM values from clearly visible fingers (e.g., pinky finger achieving 240° ROM was incorrectly reduced to 140.22°).

## Solution: Visibility-Based Validation

### Core Logic
1. **Assess finger visibility** across all motion frames using MediaPipe visibility scores
2. **Bypass temporal validation** for fingers that are clearly visible (≥80% of frames)
3. **Apply temporal validation** only when fingers show poor visibility or tracking inconsistencies

### Implementation Details

#### Visibility Assessment Configuration
```typescript
const VISIBILITY_CONFIG = {
  minLandmarkVisibility: 0.7,   // MediaPipe visibility threshold
  minFingerVisibility: 0.8,     // Average finger visibility required
  bypassTemporalIfVisible: true // Skip temporal validation for clearly visible fingers
};
```

#### Visibility Assessment Process
1. **Per-Frame Analysis**: Check MediaPipe visibility scores for all finger landmarks
2. **Overall Assessment**: Calculate percentage of frames where finger is clearly visible
3. **Decision Logic**: If ≥80% of frames show clear visibility, bypass temporal validation
4. **Fallback**: Apply temporal validation for poorly visible or inconsistent tracking

#### Enhanced ROM Processing
```typescript
// Visibility-based validation workflow
1. Assess finger visibility across all frames
2. Determine if finger is consistently well-visible
3. If clearly visible: Accept all ROM values (no temporal filtering)
4. If poorly visible: Apply temporal consistency checking
5. Log decision rationale for clinical documentation
```

## Expected Behavior Changes

### Before (Temporal-Only Validation)
- **Scenario**: Pinky finger clearly visible, genuine 240° ROM
- **Result**: ROM rejected due to sudden change, reduced to 140.22°
- **Issue**: Lost legitimate high ROM data

### After (Visibility-Based Validation)
- **Scenario**: Pinky finger clearly visible, genuine 240° ROM
- **Assessment**: 80%+ frames show clear visibility
- **Decision**: Bypass temporal validation
- **Result**: Accept full 240° ROM value
- **Benefit**: Preserve authentic high ROM measurements

### Occlusion Cases (Still Protected)
- **Scenario**: Index finger occluded by other fingers
- **Assessment**: <80% frames show clear visibility
- **Decision**: Apply temporal validation
- **Result**: Filter out tracking artifacts
- **Benefit**: Prevent overestimated ROM from occlusion

## Clinical Benefits

### Accuracy Preservation
- Legitimate high ROM values preserved for clearly visible fingers
- Maintains protection against tracking artifacts for occluded fingers
- Balanced approach respects both data integrity and tracking reliability

### Quality Indicators
- **Quality Score 1.0**: Clearly visible fingers (bypassed temporal validation)
- **Quality Score 0.3-0.9**: Temporally validated fingers (filtered data)
- **Clinical Confidence**: Higher scores indicate more reliable measurements

### Documentation
- Enhanced logging shows visibility assessment decisions
- Clear rationale for why temporal validation was applied or bypassed
- Supports clinical interpretation of ROM reliability

## Implementation Status

### Phase 1: Core Visibility Assessment ✅
- [x] MediaPipe visibility score integration
- [x] Per-finger visibility calculation
- [x] Frame-by-frame visibility tracking
- [x] Overall visibility ratio assessment

### Phase 2: Conditional Temporal Validation ✅
- [x] Bypass logic for clearly visible fingers

- [ ] Confirm clinical accuracy improvements
- [ ] Document edge cases and limitations

## Configuration Options

### Adjustable Thresholds
```typescript
// Fine-tune based on clinical requirements
minLandmarkVisibility: 0.7,    // Individual landmark threshold
minFingerVisibility: 0.8,      // Average finger visibility requirement
visibilityFrameThreshold: 0.8, // Percentage of frames required for bypass
```

### Safety Features
- Temporal validation still available as fallback
- Quality scoring maintains clinical confidence indicators
- Detailed logging supports manual review when needed
