## Dashboard Analytics & Monitoring

### AS-002: View System Overview
**As an** administrator  
**I want to** see key system metrics on the dashboard  
**So that** I can quickly assess overall system health and patient compliance  

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Dashboard displays total number of patients in the system
- Shows overall compliance rate as a percentage
- Highlights number of "at-risk" patients (3+ days since last visit)
- Displays today's completed assessments count
- All metrics update in real-time when data changes

**Dashboard Metrics:**
1. **Total Patients**: Count of all patients in the system
2. **Compliance Rate**: Percentage of active patients (based on recent activity)
3. **At Risk**: Patients who haven't completed assessments in 3+ days
4. **Today's Assessments**: Number of assessments completed today

**Visual Design:**
- Four metric cards with color-coded icons (blue, green, orange, purple)
- Responsive grid layout (1-4 columns based on screen size)
- Loading states with skeleton placeholders

## Patient Management

### AS-003: View All Patients
**As an** administrator  
**I want to** view a comprehensive list of all patients  
**So that** I can monitor their status and manage their accounts  

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Patient table shows: Patient ID, Access Code, Injury Type, Last Assessment, Status
- Each patient row displays compliance status with color coding:
  - **Green (Active)**: Last visit within 1 day
  - **Orange (At Risk)**: Last visit 2-3 days ago
  - **Red (Non-Compliant)**: Last visit 4+ days ago or inactive
- Patient avatars show last 2 digits of Patient ID
- Table includes creation date for each patient
- Loading states show skeleton rows during data fetch

**Patient Status Logic:**
- **Active**: Recent assessment activity (â‰¤ 1 day)
- **At Risk**: Moderate delay (2-3 days since last visit)
- **Non-Compliant**: Extended delay (4+ days) or marked inactive

### AS-004: Search and Filter Patients
**As an** administrator  
**I want to** search and filter the patient list  
**So that** I can quickly find specific patients or view specific status groups  

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Search functionality works on Patient ID and Injury Type
- Filter dropdown options: All Status, Active, At Risk, Non-Compliant
- Search is case-insensitive and real-time
- Filters can be combined (search + status filter)
- Clear visual feedback when no results match criteria

### AS-005: View Patient Access Codes
**As an** administrator  
**I want to** view and copy patient access codes  
**So that** I can provide them to patients for system access  

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- 6-digit access codes displayed prominently for each patient
- One-click copy functionality for each access code
- Visual confirmation when code is copied to clipboard
- Codes displayed in monospace font with blue styling
- Copy button with clipboard icon next to each code

## Patient Registration & Management

### AS-006: Add New Patients
**As an** administrator  
**I want to** register new patients with specific injury types  
**So that** they can access condition-appropriate assessments  

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Modal dialog for new patient registration
- Required injury type selection from dropdown:
  - Trigger Finger
  - Carpal Tunnel
  - Distal Radius Fracture
  - CMC Arthroplasty
- System auto-generates unique 6-digit access code
- System auto-generates unique Patient ID (format: P001, P002, etc.)
- Success notification displays generated code and Patient ID
- Patient immediately appears in the patient list
- Error handling for failed registration attempts

**Business Logic:**
- Each injury type determines which assessments are available to the patient
- Access codes are unique across the entire system
- Patient IDs follow sequential numbering (P001, P002, P003...)

## Data Export & Motion Analysis

### AS-007: Download Patient Motion Data
**As an** administrator  
**I want to** download individual patient motion capture data  
**So that** I can perform detailed analysis or share with medical professionals  

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Download button available for each patient in the table
- Data exported as JSON file format
- Filename format: `patient_{userId}_motion_data.json`
- Download includes all motion capture sessions for the patient
- Success notification confirms download initiation
- Error handling for failed download attempts

**Data Structure:**
- Hand landmarks (21 points per hand)
- Pose landmarks (when available from Holistic model)
- Handedness detection (Left/Right)
- Timestamp information for each capture session
- Assessment metadata (type, completion status)
- Quality metrics and stability measurements

### AS-008: Export System Data
**As an** administrator  
**I want to** export comprehensive system data  
**So that** I can perform system-wide analysis or backup patient information  

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- "Export Data" button in dashboard header
- Opens all patient data in new browser tab
- JSON format suitable for external analysis
- Includes patient demographics, assessment history, and compliance data

  injuryType: string;
  isActive: boolean;
  createdAt: string;
  lastVisit: string | null;
}
```

### State Management:
