Epic 1 – Dashboard Foundations
US-1.1 Set up patient list view
As a clinician, I want to open a dashboard that lists every patient I’m assigned to so that I can quickly choose whose data to review.
Acceptance Criteria

Secure login shows only patients linked to the signed-in clinician

Table columns: Patient ID, name/alias, injury type, last assessment date, status icon (e.g., ⬆ improving, ➖ stable, ⬇ declining)

Click row → navigates to that patient’s trend view

List sortable by any column and filterable by injury type or status

US-1.2 Define injury-type cohorts
As a system admin, I want injuries mapped to standardized cohort tags (e.g., “Carpal Tunnel”, “Post-op Flexor Tendon”) so cohort dashboards aggregate correctly.
Acceptance Criteria

CRUD interface for cohort definitions

Each assessment record must contain a cohort tag (auto-inherited from initial diagnosis, editable by clinicians)

Validation prevents “unknown” cohorts

Epic 2 – Individual Patient Trend Views
US-2.1 Render per-assessment time-series charts
As a clinician, I want line charts showing each assessment’s TAM, Kapandji, and wrist flex/extend angles over time so I can see healing trajectories.
Acceptance Criteria

X-axis: assessment timestamp; Y-axis: metric value

Toggle lines on/off (checkboxes)

Hover tooltip shows date, raw value, % change from baseline

Vertical guideline on hover synchronizes across all charts

US-2.2 Cumulative progress indicator
As a clinician, I need a single “% of normal ROM” gauge that updates each time an assessment is completed.
Acceptance Criteria

Formula: (current metric ÷ population normal) × 100, rounded to nearest whole %

Color-coded zones (red < 60 %, yellow 60-85 %, green > 85 %)

Baseline is first assessment unless clinician re-sets it

US-2.3 Session comparison overlay
As a clinician, I can overlay two chosen assessments to visually compare ROM changes.
Acceptance Criteria

Date picker (A vs B)

Dashed line = earlier session, solid line = later session

Numeric delta badge auto-computed for each metric

Epic 3 – Cohort Analytics
US-3.1 Aggregate cohort metrics
As a clinician, I want averaged trend lines for a cohort so I can benchmark my patient against peers.
Acceptance Criteria

Line = cohort mean; shaded band = ±1 SD

Patient’s personal line plotted in bold for context

Cohort size (n) displayed; hide if n < 5 for privacy

US-3.2 Outlier detection alert
As a clinician, I am alerted when a patient’s recovery deviates > 2 SD below cohort mean for two consecutive assessments.
Acceptance Criteria

Background task flags deviations nightly

Red badge appears on patient card and sends optional email summary

Epic 4 – Filtering, Export, & Drill-Down
US-4.1 Advanced filters panel
As a clinician, I can filter dashboard data by date range, assessment type, cohort, and device confidence score threshold.
Acceptance Criteria

Multi-select chips; “Apply” re-queries backend

State preserved on page reload (URL params)

US-4.2 CSV/JSON export
As a clinician, I can export a patient’s or cohort’s raw assessment data for research.
Acceptance Criteria

Export respects current filters

Download link expires after 15 min for security

Epic 5 – Security & Permissions
US-5.1 Role-based access control
As an admin, I need ROLES (Clinician, Researcher, Admin) with distinct permissions.
Acceptance Criteria

Clinician → only own patients

Researcher → de-identified cohort data

Admin → all data and user management

US-5.2 Audit logging
As compliance officer, I want every data export or permission change logged.
Acceptance Criteria

Log fields: user, action, timestamp, target entity

Immutable storage, exportable for HIPAA audits

Epic 6 – Performance & UX Polish
US-6.1 Lazy-load charts
As a user, charts load quickly even with large datasets.
Acceptance Criteria

Fetch only visible date window (infinite scroll or pagination)

< 2 s render time for 1-year dataset (≈ 100 assessments)

US-6.2 Mobile-responsive layout
As a clinician on tablet, I can comfortably view dashboards.
Acceptance Criteria

Breakpoints: ≥ 1024 px (desktop grid), 768-1023 px (two-column), < 768 px (single-column swipe)

Charts pinch-zoom enabled
